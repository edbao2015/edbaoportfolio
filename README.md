## Edward's Portfolio
A personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and experience, the current version you see is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Description
This portfolio website is a representation of my current skillset as a student pursuring an Information Technology Degree. It is designed to serve as
an Archives page to my resume as each resume is designed to be uniquely tailored to a specific job. I am currently working on version 1.1 of this portfolio
which will be built using **HTML5**,**node.js**, and **mySQL**. In a future version, I will add in the Projects that I have done to date. Additionally, like all  
other types of portfolios I have included an about me page and a way to contact me with a contacts page.  

## Technologies Used (as of Version 1.0):
**HTML5**
**CSS3**
**JavaScript**

## Plans for Version 1.1:
Build the Server and Database components of my portfolio using **node.js** and **mySQL**. From there, 
figuring out how to connect **node.js** to my **HTML5** will be the next key focus.
